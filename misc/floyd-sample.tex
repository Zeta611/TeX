How can a computer deal a poker hand? If we assign each card in the deck its own
integer between $1$ and $52,$ then we can make a hand from a ``random sample'' of
$5$ integers in the range $1\ltdot52,$ for instance,
\begindisplay
4\ 8\ 32\ 46\ 47
\enddisplay
(It is
important that no number appear twice; I understand that holdng more than one ace
of spaces can seriously jeopardize a card player's health.) Random samples also
arise in applications as diverse as simulation, program testing, and statistics.

The first section of this column reviews several standard algorithms for random
sampling. The next section descrives an elegant new algorithm by Bob Floyd.
%(when
%this column first appeared in {\sl Communications of the ACM,\/} Floyd's name
%was on the byline as the ``special Guest Oyster'').
%The third section then
%describes how Floyd extends his algorithm to generate random permutations of
%integers.

\beginsection 1 A Sampling of Sampling Algorithms

Before we can generate a random sample, we have to be able to generate a single
random number. We will therefore assume that we have a function $RandInt(L,U)$
that returns an integer uniformly distributed over $L\ltdot U.$\footnote\dag{\ninerm
If you don't have a $RandInt$ function, you can mae one using a function $Rand$
that returns a random real distributed unimoformly in $[0,1)$ by the expression
$L+int(Rand\times(u+1-L)).$ In the unlikely event that your system doesn't
even have that routine, consult Knuth's {\sl Seminumerical Algorithms.\/}
But whether you use a system routine or make your own, be careful that
$RandInt$ returns a value in the range $L\ltdot U$ --- a value out of range
is nasty bug.}

It is easy to generate a random sequence of $M$ integers in the range
$1\ltdot N,$ so long as we don't mind duplicates:
$$\vbox{\let\par=\endgraf
\obeylines\sfcode`;=3000
{\bf for $I:=2$ to $M$ do}
\quad {\bf print} $RandInt(1,N)$
}$$
When I invoked that program with $M$ set to $12$ and $N$ set to $3$, the code
produce the sequence
\begindisplay
3\ 1\ 3\ 3\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 2\ 1\ 1\ 3\ 1
\enddisplay
This very sequence
mgith come in handy for your next tough game of rock-paper-scissors. More serious
applications include testing finite state machines and testing sorting programs.

Many applications, though, requires a random sample without ducplicates. A
statistical anlaysis, for instance, might waste work by observing the same
element twice. Such samples are often referred to as ``samples with replacement''
for as ``combinaions''. For the remainder of this column, though, the word
``sample'' will denote a random sample with no duplicates.
%Solution~3 in Section
5.2 describes an application of a program like this.

Many sampling algorithms are based on this pseudocode, which we'll call
{\bf Algirthm S}:
$$\vbox{\let\par=\endgraf
\obeylines\sfcode`;=3000
{\bf initialize set $S$ to empty}
$Size := 0$
{\bf while $Size<M$ do}
\quad $T:=RandInt(1,N)$
\quad {\bf if $T$ is not in $S$ then}
\qquad {\bf insert $T$ in $S$}
\qquad $Size := Size + 1$
}$$
The algorithm stores the sample in the set $S$. If $S$ is implemented correctly
and if $RandInt$ produce random integers, the the algorithm produces a random
sample. That is each $M$-element subset is produced with probability $1/
{N\choose M}.$ The loop invariant is that $S$ always contains a random sample of
$Size$ integers in the range $1\ltdot N.$

There are four operations on the set $S$: initializing it to empty, testing an
integer for membership, inserting a new integer, and printing all the members.
Column~11 of my 1986 book {\sl Programming Pearls\/} sketches the algorithm and
five data structures that can be used to implement the set $S$: bit vectors,
unsorted arrays, sorted arrays, binary search tree, and bins. It also sketches
several other algorithms for sampling; see Problem~9.

\beginsection 2 Floyd's Algorithm

\Alg S\ has may virtues: it is correct, fairly efficient, and remarkably
succinct. It is so good, as a matter of face, that I thought one couldn't do
better. I therefore charge ahead and described it in detail in a column.

Unfortunately, I was wrong; fourtunately, Bob Floyd caught me sleeping. When he
studied \Alg S, he was bothered by a flaw that is displayed clearly
when $M=N=100.$ When $Size=99,$ the set $S$ contains all but one of the desired
integers. The algorithm closes its eyes and blindly guesses integers until it
stumbles over the right one, which requires 100 random numbers on the average.
That analysis assumes that the random nubmer generator is truly random. For some
nonrandom sequences, the algorithm won't even terminate.

Floyd set out to find an algorithm that uses exactly one call $RandInt$ for each
random number in $S$. The structure of Floyd's algorithm is easy to understand
recursively: to generate $5$-element sample from $1\ltdot10$, we first generate
a $4$-element sample from $1\ltdot9$, and then add the fifth element. The
recursive algorithm is sketched as \Alg{F1}:
$$\vbox{\let\par=\endgraf
\obeylines\sfcode`;=3000
{\bf function} $Sample(M, N)$
\quad {\bf if $M=0$ then}
\qquad {\bf return the empty set}
\quad {\bf else}
\qquad $S:=Sample(M-1, N-1)$
\qquad $T:=RandIt(1,N)$
\qquad {\bf if $T$ is not in $S$ then}
\qquad\quad {\bf insert $T$ in $S$}
\qquad {\bf else}
\qquad\quad {\bf insert $N$ in $S$}
\qquad {\bf return $S$}
}$$

We can appreciate the correctness of \Alg{F1} anecdotally. When
$M=5$ and $N=10$, the algorithm first recursively computes in $S$ a 4-element
random sample from $1\ltdot9$. Next it assigns to $T$ a random integer in the
range $1\ltdot10.$ Of the 10 values that $T$ can assume, exactly 5 result in
inserting 10 into $S$: the four value already in $S$, and the value 10 itself.
Thus element 10 is inserted into the set with the correct probability of $5/10$.
The next section proves that \Alg{F1} produces each $M$-element sample
of an $N$-set with equal probability.

Because \Alg{F1} uses a restricted form of recursion, Floyd was able to
translate it to an iterative form by introducing a new variable $J$. (Problem 8
and Section 3.2 discuss the problem of recursion removal in more general terms.)
The result is \Alg{F2}, witch is more efficient than \Alg S\ yet almost as
succinct:
$$\vbox{\let\par=\endgraf
\obeylines\sfcode`;=3000
{\bf initialize set $S$ to empty}
{\bf for $J:=N-M+1$ to $N$ do}
\quad $T:=RandIt(1,J)$
\quad {\bf if $T$ is not in $S$ then}
\qquad\quad {\bf insert $T$ in $S$}
\quad {\bf else}
\qquad\quad {\bf insert $J$ in $S$}
}$$

\bye

Problem 2 and 3 address the data structures that mgith be used to implement the
set $S$.

For thoes who mgiht scoff that \Alg{F2} is ``just pseudocode'', the next program
implements Floyd's algorithm in the Awk language. The associative array described
in Column 2 provide a clean implementation of the set $S$. Awk's {\tt ARGV} array
allows the program to access command line arguments, so a sample of 200 elements
in the range $1\ltdot1000$ can be generated by typing {\tt sample 200 1000}.
Complete with input and output, the Awk program requires only eight lines:
\begintt
BEGIN { m = ARGV[1]; n = ARGV[2]
        for (j = n-m+1; j <= n; j++) {
            t = 1 + int(j * rand())
            if (t in s) s[j] = 1
            else s[t] = 1
        }
        for (i in s) print i
}
\endtt
